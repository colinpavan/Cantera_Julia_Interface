# Cantera_Julia_Interface
# cpavan 2021-10-20

This project is a julia interface for Cantera
I have been building it and adding functionality as I need it, but it is far from done
Currently, it is just a way to access the property data

To use, the library libcantera_shared.so must be on your system search path (on linux)
this library can be constructed by directly compiling the cantera c++ source code
follow instructions on: https://cantera.org/

Some examples of usage are in the file cantera_interface_demo
